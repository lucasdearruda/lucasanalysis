FACILITY   (CYCLO,2BLGLVN)  Fast neutron facility cyclotron
                            'CYCLONE'
INC-SOURCE (P-LI7)  65 MeV proton beam strikes 3 mm thick
             natural lithium target. proton current is 12 micro-A
             producing ~1.0E+5 neutrons/cm2/sec at the location
             of the target
INC-SPECT   Full width at half-maximum is ~2 MeV containing
            90% of neutrons/MeV plus a flat continuum of
            low-energy neutrons.
           -For energy calibration the proton and deuteron recoi-
            ling from respectively a polypropylene (1 mm thick)
            and deuterated polypropylene target (0.6 mm thick)
            were used.
           (EN-RSL) -half width of the incident neutron energy bin
DETECTOR   (COIN,TELES,SCIN,CSICR)  Four charged particles
             detector consisting of six telescopes were used
             simultaneously, each of them consists of
             1.  'Delta-E' Detector NE102 plastic scintillator,
                  0.1 mm thick, 4 cm in diameter, and
             2.   Cs-I(TL) 'E' detector, crystal 22 mm thick,
                  38.1 mm in diameter
METHOD     (TOF)  The time-of-flight was deduced from the
              time difference between the capacitive beam pickoff
              located upstream from the neutron-producing target,
              and the delta-E detector. only those events of
              charged particles detection  were registered which
              are associated with neutrons in the main neutron
              peak.
           (COINC,EDE)
ANALYSIS    Interpolation and extrapolation of double-differential
            data was performed with the help of two-parameter
            formula a*exp(b*cos(theta)), theta is angle of scatte-
            ring in lab. system
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA)   Cross sections were measured
             at degrees between 20 and 70 degree with step 10 deg,
             110, 140 and 160 degree in each of the telescopes

SAMPLE      Natural iron target 0.5 mm thick, 6*6 cm2 surface,
            density 2.4 gram/cm2
CORRECTION  The solid angle and thick target corrections were
            made with the help of Monte Carlo simulation program
ADD-RES    (THEO,COMP)  GNASH and TALYS codes were used for light
              charged particles cross sections evaluation.
           The iron data are also compared with previously
           published cobalt results (see Entry 22810).
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) Total error includes ERR-SYS and DATA-ERR
             (as it is given in thesis)
           (ERR-SYS,7.,8.) uncertainty of the cross section
            absolute scale due to:
           (ERR-1) uncertainty in the measured reference (n,p)
                  cross sections (5%),
           (ERR-2) uncertainty in the beam monitoring (2%),
           (ERR-3,2.,5.) uncertainty in the statistics in the
                         H(n,p) recoil proton peak (2-5%),
           (ERR-4) uncertainty in solid angle corrections (1%),
           (ERR-5) uncertainty in number of target nuclei, etc.
           (DATA-ERR,5.5) The overall relative uncertainties of
           the experimental points in the spectra are about 5.5%,
           8.5%, 15.% and 25% for respectively p, d, t and alpha
           at 62.7 MeV. They are mainly given by the statistics
           in the spectra. At lower ejectile energies, the thick
           target corrections contribute with supplementary
           uncertainties. For all the other incident neutron
           energies (continuum), these values are between 2 and 3
           times higher as a consequence of the lower incident
           neutron flux.
COMMENT    Prof.Raeymackers recommended to adopt values in the
           Atom.Data&Nucl.Data Tabl.87(2004)231-305 article rather
           than the values in J.Phys.G30(2004)45-64
